# Hazakura for Emacs
This is a port of the `hazakura` colorscheme for Emacs, using [autothemer](https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer).

This is the default theme for [dianciemacs](https://github.com/devraza/dianciemacs) - rather, this theme was created specifically for it.

> **Note**: an independant variant of the theme (that is, one that does not rely on `autothemer`) has been produced by [Haider Mirza](https://github.com/Haider-Mirza). See the `independant` branch for details.
